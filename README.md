# personal_website
FSA personal website project

This website is meant as a personal portfolio, made for the FullStack Academy web development bootcamp that I am attending. It includes three main HTML pages, all styled by the same CSS file. 

I will update this site as I add to my programming portfolio, and expand my web development knowledge.
